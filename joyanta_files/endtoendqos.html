  <h2>Provisioning quality of service (qos) in distributed storage</h2>

Quality of service or qos management plays a vital role to provide differentiated services to different users (clients/applications). 
The service provider makes service level agreement (SLA) with the clients to guarantee the qos. 
For example: the client makes a SLA with the service provider that, the response time will never exceeds 10 millisecond, for 99.99% of the packets. 
In terms of network and storage, the QoS parameters could be delay, jitter, packet loss etc. and bandwidth, iops, etc. respectively.

The networks qos is well defined in many protocol implementations (e.g. COS in 802.1Q and DSCP in layer 3 network). But providing qos in a distributed storage system is difficult for a couple of reasons: 
<ul>
  <li>
    The semantic gap between the file level (host side) and the block level information (storage side), there is little/no relation between the semantics.
For example: it is not possible to find an association between the blocks to file or block to applications. So without additional management, storage servers/block devices can not guarantee the qos defined by the application.
  </li>
  <li>
    Network plays a vital role to ensure the end to end qos, for example, a network switch queued up all the requests and follow FIFO! That could be devastating for a delay sensitive applications. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Different application qos requirement might conflict and might cause <a href="https://www.flashmemorysummit.com/English/Collaterals/Proceedings/2017/20170809_SIT6_Petersen.pdf">noisy neighbour</a> kind of situation for other applications. Besides that, is it possible to 
    What additional parameters/features are needed to achieve a consistent and yet flexible end to end QoS implementation?
  </li>
</ul>
	
  In this work, we try to address the three issues mentioned above. This work mainly focuses on both the NVME over Fabrics (nvme-of)
and Persistent memory over Fabrics (pm-of) protocol, and different QoS requirement by different applications, running over those 
protocols.
